Observable Trends in the Pyber Data:

The first observable trend is noticeable in the Pyber bubble plot. It is noticeable that the fees per city type depend heavily on the number of rides.
For example, it can be seen that there are a large abundance of Urban city type rides, and the fees are significatnly lower than those for rural cities.

The second observable trend is found in the total fares by city type pie chart. It is noticeable that the sales coming from urban cities make up
62.7% of all fares for Pyber, due to the fact there are so many more Urban rides than both suburban and rural cities.

The third observable trend is the data correlation between rides and total drivers. Due to there being so many more rides in urban citites,
there are then a nearly proportional amount of drivers present in these cities due to demand. This is shown in the pie charts for total drivers, and total rides per city.
